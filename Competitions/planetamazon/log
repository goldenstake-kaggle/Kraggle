training
rf1: random forest with PCA on 80% of training set (distribution for each outcome preserved). All training includes the "all-zero" weather row, except for weather aggregate. 
rf2: rf1 without PCA
rf3: rf1 without PCA, with zv, nzv, and corr
nn1: rf1 but with method = "nnet", preprocess = "range"
